                <p class="s">I love toys since I was young especially fury toys. I was the wish of my mom and dad and so they gave me everything what I want. I have aunty and they don't have children, so I was lucky when I was young:xD. When I was scolded from mom, I went to my aunty house. Sometimes, grandma's home or sometimes, to my big aunty house. I was a happy kid when I was young. The all family treated me as a princess. Ps: I got a lot of pocket money from my uncle and aunty:xD ü´∂üèª</p>

                <p class="bbb">My parents told I was very sensitive since I was young. (I'm now trying my best to fix that:xD). I didn't look back or talk to other people even if they're my parent's friends. I was really tired because of my personality. I don't like other people touching my toys or eating mine. Btw I didn't play with other children who were the same age with me. Also my mom didn't let me to play with random children. And then I chose children with whom I wanted to be friends and played only with them. They were really good friends for me. Although we don't have many things to talk now, I always remember them. I wish they also remember me. Ohh! I forgot my cousin brother lol. He's like my friend because our age difference is only 11 months. He was the main reason I can live without other friends lol. I wasn't never lazy with him and we're really matched to each other. miss u too, koko. I would like to go our childhood days with you guys, precious memories. ü§ç </p>
